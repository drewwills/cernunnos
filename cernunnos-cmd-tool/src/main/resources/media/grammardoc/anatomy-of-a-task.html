<h2>Anatomy of a Task</h2>

<p>The capabilities of Cernunnos come in tidy packages:  <em>tasks</em> and 
<em>phrases</em>.  The Cernunnos Runtime Environment does the magic of assembling 
these components into useful bundles of software based on your specifications.  
On a basic level, you don't have to know <em>how</em> these capabilities work to 
use them;  you simply tell Cernunnos <em>what</em> you need.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, to get the most from Cernunnos it's better to be able to look 
below the surface.</p>

<p>Most java classes in Cernunnos implement one or the other of the these two 
core interfaces:  <code>Task</code> or <code>Phrase</code>.  </p>

<a name="FooTask"/>
<h3>FooTask.java</h3>

<p>In order to get to know how tasks work, we will look at a made-up task called 
<code>FooTask</code> (<a href="examples/FooTask.java.html">view complete Java 
code</a>).  This task executes a <em>foo</em> operation, which we loosely define 
with the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Compute the value of a <em>foo</em> object</li>
  <li>
    Make the foo object available to subtasks as a 
    <a href="request-attributes.html">request attribute</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Callers may optionally specify the name of this attribute, 
    though a default name will be used if they don't
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Getting Started</h4>

<p>The <code>FooTask</code> resides in the <code>org.danann.cernunnos.foo</code> 
package.</p>

<blockquote><code><pre>
package org.danann.cernunnos.foo;

import org.apache.commons.logging.Log;
import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory;

import org.danann.cernunnos.AbstractContainerTask;
import org.danann.cernunnos.EntityConfig;
import org.danann.cernunnos.Formula;
import org.danann.cernunnos.LiteralPhrase;
import org.danann.cernunnos.Phrase;
import org.danann.cernunnos.Reagent;
import org.danann.cernunnos.ReagentType;
import org.danann.cernunnos.SimpleFormula;
import org.danann.cernunnos.SimpleReagent;
import org.danann.cernunnos.TaskRequest;
import org.danann.cernunnos.TaskResponse;
</pre></code></blockquote>

<p>For our <code>FooTask</code>, note that all other Cernunnos types we import 
come from the same package:  <code>org.danann.cernunnos</code>.  This is the 
root package of Cernunnos and the parent of the <code>foo</code>package.  This 
relationship illustrates an important principal of dependency organization in 
Cernunnos:  <strong>import statements may only go <em>up</em> the package 
tree</strong>.  Java classes in Cernunnos may never import down, such as from 
<code>a.b.c</code> to <code>a.b.c.d</code>, or laterally, such as from 
<code>a.b.c.d</code> to <code>a.b.c.e</code>.</p>

<h4>Class Declaration</h4>

<p>Every task must implement the <code>Task</code> interface either directly or 
indirectly, such as by subclassing <code>AbstractContainerTask</code>.</p>

<blockquote><code><pre>
public final class FooTask extends AbstractContainerTask {
</pre></code></blockquote>

<p>The <code>FooTask</code> extends <code>AbstractContainerTask</code>, which 
means it supports <em>subtasks</em>.  It's not mandatory for tasks that support 
subtasks to subclass <code>AbstractContainerTask</code>, but it makes the 
process easier.</p>

<p>Our <code>FooTask</code> is <code>final</code> because it's not designed for 
inheritance.  Many Java engineers feel that this is a good practice generally:  
make classes either <code>abstract</code> or <code>final</code>, depending if 
they're designed to be subclassed or not, respectively.</p>

<h4>Phrases &amp; Reagents</h4>

<p>The <code>FooTask</code> has three member variables, which are 
<code>private</code>, and two class variables, which are <code>public</code>.</p>

<blockquote><code><pre>
// Instance Members.
private Phrase attribute_name;
private Phrase foo;
private final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(getClass());

/*
 * Public API.
 */

public static final Reagent ATTRIBUTE_NAME = new SimpleReagent("ATTRIBUTE_NAME", "@attribute-name", 
        ReagentType.PHRASE, String.class, "Optional name under which the value of FOO will be " +
        "registered as a request attribute.  If omitted, the name 'FooAttributes.FOO' will be " +
        "used.", new LiteralPhrase(FooAttributes.FOO));

public static final Reagent FOO = new SimpleReagent("FOO", "@foo", ReagentType.PHRASE, String.class, 
        "The foo object that will be available to subtasks as the request attribute specified by " +
        "ATTRIBUTE_NAME.");
</pre></code></blockquote>

<p>Observe how the '<code>attribute_name</code>' and '<code>foo</code>' 
variables correspond to class variables with similar names:  each pairing works 
in concert to support a single concept.  The member variables are instances of 
<code>Phrase</code>;  the class variables are instances of <code>Reagent</code>.  
The <code>FooTask</code> uses <em>reagents</em> to tell the Cernunnos Runtime 
about the information it will need to do it's work.  It uses <em>phrases</em> to 
get that information when the time is right.</p>

<p>Both reagents include a <em>name</em>, an <em>XPath expression</em>, a 
<em>reagent type</em>, an expected <em>return type</em>, and a 
<em>description</em> -- in that order.  The <code>ATTRIBUTE_NAME</code> reagent 
also specifies a default value.  <strong>Defaults should be provided where 
possible and sensible</strong>, since they allow authors to accept them tacitly 
in the majority of cases.</p>

<a name="FooAttributes"/>
<p>The default value of the <code>ATTRIBUTE_NAME</code> reagent uses a special 
class:  <code>FooAttributes</code>.  Cernunnos uses Java classes that 
end in '<code>-Attributes</code>' to define standard names for common request 
attributes.  Whenever two (or more) tasks and/or phrases use the same, standard 
name for something by default, they establish a pattern of cooperation that is 
<em>implied</em> or <em>tacit</em>:  as long as neither default is overridden, 
they cooperate automatically.  See the 
<a href="examples/FooAttributes.java.html">Java code</a> for this class.</p>

<p>The Cernunnos Manual documents the information specified by reagents 
in the task and phrase reference;  the name and description are provided purely 
for this purpose.  The Cernunnos Runtime uses the XPath expression to analyze 
the value of the reagent, and the reagent type determines how that value will be 
calculated.  Currently, the return type just acts as a hint, signaling when the 
author may have made a mistake (allowing Cernunnos to issue a warning).  We 
hope that return types can help Cernunnos provide support for 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_coercion" target="_new">type coercion</a> 
in the future.</p>

<h4>The <code>getFormula()</code> Method</h4>

<p>Tasks and phrases both implement the <code>Bootstrappable</code> interface, 
which declares two methods.  The first of these is <code>getFormula()</code>.</p>

<blockquote><code><pre>
public Formula getFormula() {
    Reagent[] reagents = new Reagent[] {ATTRIBUTE_NAME, FOO, AbstractContainerTask.SUBTASKS};
    final Formula rslt = new SimpleFormula(getClass(), reagents);
    return rslt;
}
</pre></code></blockquote>

<p>As you might expect, the <code>getFormula()</code> method provides a 
<code>Formula</code> object to the Cernunnos Runtime.  The <em>formula</em> of a 
task (or phrase) describes its essential metadata:  <i>e.g.</i> what Java class 
implements it, what reagents it uses, and whether it's been deprecated.  The 
information in the formula tells Cernunnos how to bootstrap the 
<code>FooTask</code> properly and how to document it accurately in the Cernunnos 
Manual.</p>

<h4>The <code>init()</code> Method</h4>

<p>The second method that <code>Bootstrappable</code> defines is 
<code>init()</code>.</p>

<blockquote><code><pre>
public void init(EntityConfig config) {

    super.init(config);

    // Instance Members.
    this.attribute_name = (Phrase) config.getValue(ATTRIBUTE_NAME);
    this.foo = (Phrase) config.getValue(FOO);

}
</pre></code></blockquote>

<p>The Cernunnos Runtime calls this method on every task (or phrase) before 
putting it into service.  The <code>init()</code> method will be called exactly 
once.</p>

<p>Task implementations use the <code>init()</code> method to prepare themselves 
for service.  The Cernunnos Runtime passes an <code>EntityConfig</code> object, 
which provides access to some essential resources.  Perhaps the most important 
of these resources are the <em>values</em> of reagents declared by the formula.  
In general, task implementations will "link up" their reagents with member 
variables in the <code>init()</code> method.</p>

<p>The <code>FooTask</code> connects two member variables in this way:  
'<code>attribute_name</code>' and '<code>foo</code>.'  Both of these variables 
are references of type <code>Phrase</code>.  Reagents usually work with phrases, 
though there are some exceptions.  <code>FooTask</code> also calls 
<code>super.init()</code>, allowing <code>AbstractContainerTask</code> to 
bootstrap <em>its</em> reagents as well.</p>

<h4>The <code>perform()</code> Method</h4>

<p>All <code>Task</code> implementations work their magic in the 
<code>perform()</code> method.  Unlike <code>getFormula()</code> and 
<code>init()</code> above, <code>perform()</code> applies only to tasks;  
phrases implement a different (but similar) method called 
<code>evaluate()</code>.</p>

<blockquote><code><pre>
public void perform(TaskRequest req, TaskResponse res) {

    Object f = null;
    try {
        final String name = (String) attribute_name.evaluate(req, res);
        f = foo.evaluate(req, res);
        res.setAttribute(name, f);
        if (log.isInfoEnabled()) {
            log.info("The FooTask performed the foo operation " +
                    "successfully.  The 'foo' object is:  " + f);
        }
    } catch (Throwable t) {
        String msg = "The FooTask failed to foo properly.  The 'foo' " +
                                            "object is:  " + f;
        throw new RuntimeException(msg, t);
    }

    super.performSubtasks(req, res);

}
</pre></code></blockquote>

<p>The Cernunnos Runtime provides a <code>TaskRequest</code> and a 
<code>TaskResponse</code>;  these are similar to request/response objects in 
Java Servlets, Java Portlets, and numerous other container-managed APIs both 
within the <a href="http://java.sun.com/index.jsp" target="_new">Java Platform</a> 
and elsewhere.  The <em>request</em> provides inputs to the task, most notably 
<em>request attributes</em>.  The <em>response</em> gives tasks somewhere to 
direct their outputs, which, incidentally, are often request attributes for 
subtasks.</p>

<p>The <code>FooTask</code> first invokes <code>evaluate()</code> on its 
phrases:  '<code>attribute_name</code>' and '<code>foo</code>.'  Notice that 
<code>evaluate()</code> also uses the request and response;  phrases get their 
inputs in the same manner as tasks (though their outputs are handled 
differently).  <code>FooTask</code> does not know the actual value of the items 
its phrases represent until they are evaluated in the <code>perform()</code> 
method.  These values depend on contextual circumstances (<i>e.g.</i> the work 
of other tasks and phrases), and can be different each time the task is 
invoked.</p>

<p>All runtime-managed objects in Cernunnos (<i>viz.</i> both tasks and phrases) 
are obligated <em>not</em> to maintain stateful information between calls to 
<code>perform()</code>/<code>evaluate()</code>;  this kind of information must 
be maintained in the request and response objects.  Cernunnos objects are 
therefore both <em>reusable</em> and <em>thread-safe</em>.  Instances of 
<code>TaskRequest</code> and <code>TaskResponse</code> are neither reusable nor 
thread-safe.</p>

<p>With the real value of the '<code>foo</code>' phrase in hand, the 
<code>FooTask</code> uses the response to create a new request attribute under 
the name specified by '<code>attribute_name</code>.'  This attribute will be 
visible to all subtasks.  This is the sole purpose of <code>FooTask</code>;  
from here, it only has to invoke its subtasks.</p>

<p>Now that its own work is done, the <code>FooTask</code> takes a moment to log 
the outcome of its efforts.  Cernunnos uses the 
<a href="http://commons.apache.org/logging/">Apache Commons Logging</a> package, 
which is a <i>de facto</i> industry standard.  Information about components 
operating normally (<i>i.e.</i> without exceptions or surprises) is logged at 
the <code>TRACE</code> level.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, an exception does arise while <code>FooTask</code> 
does its work, it will be caught and execution will pass into the 
<code>catch</code> block.  In this case, our task will wrap whatever it catches 
in a <code>RuntimeException</code> with a message describing everything known 
about the <em>foo</em> operation at the time of failure.  Under the hood, the 
Cernunnos Runtime wraps this exception with a <code>ManagedException</code>, 
which provides helpful information about the source of the error within the 
Cernunnos XML document that contains our <code>FooTask</code>.</p>

<p>Lastly the <code>FooTask</code> invokes its subtasks with 
<code>super.performSubtasks()</code>.  Notice that our task calls this method 
<em>outside</em> the try/catch block in which it does its own work.  This 
practice prevents the stack trace from swelling with information that's not 
especially useful and may even be misleading, and is emerging as the recommended 
pattern for tasks that support subtasks.</p>
