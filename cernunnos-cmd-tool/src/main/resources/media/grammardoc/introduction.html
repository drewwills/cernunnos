  <h1>Cernunnos Manual</h1>
</div>

<hr/>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Cernunnos Project makes Java professionals more effective by helping
them reuse their work extensively.  Reused code has three very significant
advantages:  (1) it takes less time to write;  (2) it's already been tested;
and (3) there are more projects in which to discover and fix subtle bugs that
make it through testing.</p>

<h3>How It Works</h3>

<p>Contemporary software systems are mostly built like jigsaw puzzles:  although
they are made up of components, the components only really combine in one way.
The reason for this condition is that industry-normal programming practices
include designing the <em>shape</em> of components (i.e. the way in which they
connect to other components) together and in accordance with their
<em>function</em>.  The result is components that look a lot like what they do.
Components that collaborate with other components must be coded to fit them
explicitly.  New collaborations require refactoring, forking, or simply
rewriting one or more participants.</p>

<p>Cernunnos seeks to define the shape of software components independent of
their function.  Put another way, Cernunnos makes software less like puzzle
pieces and more like Lego bricks.  Since all the components have the same shape,
the number of possible combinations is open-ended.</p>

<h3>Tasks &amp; Phrases</h3>

<p>Cernunnos organizes software components into two categories:  <em>Tasks</em>
and <em>Phrases</em>.  Developers tell these components how to combine using a
separate, succinct, XML document.  This approach is conceptually similar to
<a href="http://www.springframework.org" target="_top">Spring Dependency
Injection</a>.</p>

<h4>Tasks</h4>

<p>A <em>task</em> is a unit of work.  Tasks are like verbs;  they describe
<em>what operations will be performed</em>.  Cernunnos represents tasks using
XML elements, as in the following example:</p>

<blockquote><code><pre><xmp><file-iterator>
  <copy-file/>
</file-iterator></xmp></pre></code></blockquote>

<p>Both <code>&lt;file-iterator&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;copy-file&gt;</code>
are tasks.  All together, this XML structure tells Java to iterate over a set of
files, copying each one in turn.</p>

<h4>Phrases</h4>

<p>A <em>phrase</em> is an expression that evaluates to a value.  Phrases are
like nouns;  they describe <em>who performs operations</em> and <em>to, for, or
upon whom they will be performed</em>.  Cernunnos uses phrases to parameterize
tasks, and <em>usually</em> represents them as XML attributes.  Here is the same
example (as above) with phrases:</p>

<blockquote><code><pre><xmp><file-iterator dir="some_folder">
  <copy-file to-dir="another_folder"/>
</file-iterator></xmp></pre></code></blockquote>

<p>Both <code>dir</code> and <code>to-dir</code> have phrases as their values.
This updated XML structure tells Java code to iterate over the files in
'some_folder', copying each one to 'another_folder' in turn.</p>

<p>The examples 'some_folder' and 'another_folder' are both literal expressions;
they always evaluate to themselves.  Frequently the value needed from a phrase
is static and known at design-time, but not always.  Phrase expressions can be
dynamic, for example:</p>

<blockquote><code>
  ${req(Attributes.NODE)}<br/>
  ${valueOf(channel/title)}<br/>
  ${sysprop(user.dir)}
</code></blockquote>

<p>Dynamic phrase expressions always start with '<code>${phrase-impl(</code>'
and end with '<code>)}</code>', where <em>phrase-impl</em> is the name or
fully-qualified Java class of a phrase implementation.</p>

<p>Phrase expressions may also be concatenated:</p>

<blockquote><code>
  /WEB-INF/jsp/MyPortlet/${req(pageName)}.jsp<br/>
  ${req(TARGET_DIR)}/${req(Attributes.LOCATION)}
</code></blockquote>

<p>And/or nested:</p>

<blockquote><code>
  ${url(${req(HTTP_ROOT)}${req(TARGET_DIR)}${req(Attributes.LOCATION)})}
</code></blockquote>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Here's a short example that combines tasks and phrases to do something useful:</p>

<blockquote><code><pre><xmp><file-iterator includes="**/*.jar">
  <echo-ln>${req(Attributes.LOCATION)}:</echo-ln>
  <archive-iterator>
    <if test="${jexl(Attributes.LOCATION.contains('${req($1)}'))}">
      <echo-ln prefix="&#009;">${req(Attributes.LOCATION)}</echo-ln>
    </if>
  </archive-iterator>
  <echo-ln/>
</file-iterator></xmp></pre></code></blockquote>

<p>This configuration looks for JAR file entries that match a specified pattern
(provided on the command line), starting with the current directory and including all
subdirectories recursively.</p>

<p>If you save this XML to a file named 'find-class-in-jar.crn', you can invoke
it from the command line like this:</p>

<blockquote><code>
> crn find-class-in-jar.crn SAX
</code></blockquote>

<p>And you might get results like these:</p>

<blockquote><code><pre>
