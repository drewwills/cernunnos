${req($1)},

I'd like to turn your attention for a moment to a pet project I've been brewing for about a year:  Cernunnos.  I've created an Open Source Java project hosted by Google Code to manage it.  You can check it out at the following address:

  http://code.google.com/p/cernunnos/

It's hard to say in a few words what Cernunnos is.  It's a bit like the story of the blind men and the elephant -- describing a part of it doesn't adequately convey the big picture.

In one sense Cernunnos is a *task harness*:  useful operations can be implemented abstractly as _tasks_, and later instrumented and combined to satisfy current and future needs.

You could also say that Cernunnos promotes interoperability.  It provides a _thin layer of lubrication_ between systems, technologies, and existing Java code.

Cernunnos has been used -- almost exclusively by me, unfortunately -- to do a wide variety of things:
  - analyze changes to a database
  - compile documentation for a software project (viz. this one)
  - automate business processes for a Vacation Rental business
  - search JAR archives for classes with names that match a regular expression

In fact, this email was sent to you programmatically using Cernunnos, and it's content was pulled from a Subversion repository at the following location:

  http://cernunnos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/media/Invitation.txt

Cernunnos is simple to install, simple to use, and simple to extend.  Please take a look and consider sharing some of your expertise.

There is also a Google Groups community for Cernunnos discussion.  You can visit it here:

  http://groups.google.com/group/cernunnos-discussion

There you can find a lot of helpful information and useful scripts for Cernunnos.

Thanks,

Andrew Wills
