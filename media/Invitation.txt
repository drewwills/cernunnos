Dear ${req($1)},

I want to invite you to discover Cernunnos, a new Open Source initiative hosted by Google Code.  You can check it out at the following address:

  http://code.google.com/p/cernunnos/

Cernunnos is a Java technology designed to promote and support effective Object Oriented development.  It can help you do all sorts of things, and is not limited to a particular domain or problem space.

For example, it has been used to analyze changes to a database and to compile documentation for a software project (viz. this one).

In fact, this email was sent to you using a Script written for Cernunnos, and it's content was pulled from a Subversion repository using the following address:

  http://cernunnos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/media/Invitation.txt

Cernunnos is simple to install, simple to use, and simple to extend.

Please take a look and consider sharing some of your expertise.

Sincerely,

Andrew Wills
