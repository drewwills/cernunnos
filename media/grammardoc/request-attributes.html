<h2>Request Attributes</h2>

<p>In Cernunnos, tasks and phrases use <em>Request Attributes</em> as a common
means of collaborating with one another.  Request attributes are a collection of
contextual information organized as a <code>Map</code>:  attribute values may be
any type of <code>Object</code>, but keys are always <code>String</code>s.</p>

<h3>Setting Request Attributes</h3>

<p>You can create request attributes in several ways;  perhaps the most common
(and most broadly applicable) method is the
<a href="entries/with-attribute.html"><code>&lt;with-attribute&gt;</code>
task</a>.  This task registers any <code>Object</code> (specified by the
<code>VALUE</code> reagent) under any name (specified by the <code>KEY</code>).
The resulting name/value pair will be visible to all subtasks:  this is the role
and the entire purpose of the <code>&lt;with-attribute&gt;</code> task.</p>

<p>Conversely, some tasks that set request attributes have other duties.  The
<a href="entries/sql-connection.html"><code>&lt;sql-connection&gt;</code>
task</a> is a great example.  <code>&lt;sql-connection&gt;</code> is responsible
for opening a JDBC connection to an SQL data source.  This connection is then
made available to subtasks of <code>&lt;sql-connection&gt;</code>, which use it
to execute SQL statements.  Once all subtasks have completed,
<code>&lt;sql-connection&gt;</code> closes the SQL connection in accordance with
JDBC best practices.</p>

<p>You can optionally designate the name of the request attribute that will
contain the SQL connection through the <code>ATTRIBUTE_NAME</code> reagent.  If
you don't specify a name, a default name will be used (more on this topic
below).  Tasks that open or establish resources for the benefit of subtasks
commonly support the <code>ATTRIBUTE_NAME</code> reagent.  These include
<a href="entries/invoke-method.html"><code>&lt;invoke-method&gt;</code></a>,
<a href="entries/node-iterator.html"><code>&lt;node-iterator&gt;</code></a>, and
<a href="entries/print-stream.html"><code>&lt;print-stream&gt;</code></a>.</p>

<h3>Getting Request Attributes</h3>

<p>The usual way to access the value of a request attribute is through the
<a href="entries/req.html"><code>${req()}</code> phrase</a>.  Just put the name
of the desired request attribute between the parentheses, like so:</p>

<blockquote><code>$req(Attributes.LOCATION)</code></blockquote>

<p>Just like tasks, phrases use reagents to accept inputs;  the expression
'<code>Attributes.LOCATION</code>' above is associated with the <code>KEY</code>
reagent of <code>${req()}</code>.  Unlike tasks, typically phrases may only have
one reagent.</p>

<h3>Other Important Considerations</h3>

<p>Request attributes exhibit some characteristics that may catch unwary
programmers off guard;  don't worry, they will make complete sense one you get
used to them (we hope).  Be aware of the following considerations when dealing
with request attributes.</p>

<h4>Last In, First Out (LIFO)</h4>

<p>Request attributes have a lifecycle:  they exist only within the scope of the
task that creates them.  In other words, they are visible to descendants, but
not to ancestors or siblings.</p>

<p>Request attributes may also <em>cover</em> other request attributes.  This
process occurs whenever a task registers an attribute with the same name as an
existing attribute.  In this case, the new attribute will be visible within the
scope of the task that (re)registered it;  the covered attribute will be
inaccessible.</p>

<h4>Default Reagent Values</h4>

<p>Many tasks and phrases provide default values for some or all of their
reagents through standard, well-known request attributes.  Consider this
example:</p>

<blockquote><code><pre><xmp><with-attribute key="SqlAttributes.DATA_SOURCE" value="${jndi(java:comp/env/jdbc/PortalDb)}">
  <sql-connection>
    <sql-statement sql="DELETE FROM up_layout_struct WHERE user_id = ?">
      <parameter value="${sql(SELECT user_id FROM up_user WHERE user_name = '${req(username)}')}"/>
    </sql-statement>
  </sql-connection>
</with-attribute></xmp></pre></code></blockquote>

<p>Who told <code>&lt;sql-connection&gt;</code> how to connect to the database?
Who told <code>&lt;sql-statement&gt;</code> or <code>${sql()}</code> what JDBC
connection to use?</p>

<p>No one did -- at least, not explicitly.  This information is communicated
through a system of conventional request attributes.  Since
<code>&lt;sql-connection&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;sql-statement&gt;</code>, and
<code>${sql()}</code> each agree on the convention, you can leave these mundane
details out of your scripts in 99% of cases.  For the remaining 1% of cases, you
have the opportunity to specify a <code>DataSource</code> or
<code>Connection</code> object explicitly.</p>

<h4>Naming Schemes for Common Attributes</h4>

<p>Request attributes that serve as default values for reagents are given names
according to a convention:  first a name like "Attributes" or "SqlAttributes"
(roughly corresponding to Java package names), followed by a period '.'
character, followed by a noun in uppercase (multi-word nouns are separated by
underscore '_' characters).  For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>Attributes.CONTEXT</code></li>
	<li><code>Attributes.LOCATION</code></li>
	<li><code>SqlAttributes.DATA_SOURCE</code></li>
	<li><code>XmlAttributes.ENTITY_RESOLVER</code></li>
</ul>

<p><i>Ad-hoc</i> request attributes need not (and probably <em>should not</em>) adhere to this convention.</p>

<h3>Request Attributes at Startup</h3>

<p>Depending on how you use Cernunnos, one or more request attributes may be
present in the collection even before the first task is invoked.</p>

<h4><code>Attributes.ORIGIN</code></h4>

<p>The value of this attribute is a URL (in <code>String</code> form)
representing the absolute location of the current script.  It set by the
Cernunnos runtime whenever a <code>Task</code> object is created from a file --
whether read over HTTP, over FTP, from the classpath, from the local file
system, <i>etc</i>.</p>

<p><code>Attributes.ORIGIN</code> is tremendously useful because it allows you
to reference additional resources -- XSLT stylesheets, properties files, other
Cernunnos scripts, <i>etc</i>. -- using relative path expressions.  Thanks to
this attribute, you don't have to know where resources will be when they are
ultimately deployed;  you only have to know where they are <i>relative to the
script that uses them</i>.  Pass <code>Attributes.ORIGIN</code> to the
<code>CONTEXT</code> reagent of a task that uses an external resource;  it will
then evaluate the <code>LOCATION</code> of that resource relative to the current
script.</p>

<p>There are, moreover, several tasks that use <code>Attributes.ORIGIN</code> as
the default value for their <code>CONTEXT</code> reagent.  Some examples are
<a href="entries/properties.html"><code>&lt;properties&gt;</code></a> and
<a href="entries/crn.html"><code>&lt;crn&gt;</code></a>.  These tasks will
evaluate <code>LOCATION</code> relative to the current script if
<code>CONTEXT</code> is omitted.</p>

<h4>Command Line Attributes</h4>

<p>When you invoke Cernunnos from the command line, you may optionally specify
request attributes as command line parameters.  Take a look at this example:</p>

<blockquote><code><pre>
> crn good-advice.crn many hands make light work

 INFO [main] runtime.ScriptRunner.[] Nov/28 21:00:14 -
**************************************************
** Invoking ScriptRunner.run(Task, TaskRequest)
** TaskRequest contains 6 elements
**   - $3=make
**   - $1=many
**   - Attributes.ORIGIN=file:/C:/HOME/danann/cernunnos/good-advice.crn
**   - $5=work
**   - $2=hands
**   - $4=light
**************************************************
</pre></code></blockquote>

<p>The first parameter is always the location of the script (can be relative,
absolute, or a URL).  Subsequent parameters are added to the collection of
request attributes as <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, and so on.</p>

<h4>Web Application Attributes</h4>

<p>Cernunnos has been used to develop several
<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=168">Java Portlets</a>.  For detailed
instructions on how to create portlets with Cernunnos, refer to
<a href="http://www.unicon.net/node/822">this article</a>.</p>

<p>The Cernunnos portlet class
(<code>org.danann.cernunnos.runtime.web.CernunnosPortlet</code>) can pre-load
the request with useful attributes whenever it invokes a script. For starters,
it creates request attributes for the two objects provided by the portlet
container in each action or render cycle:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>WebAttributes.REQUEST</code></li>
	<li><code>WebAttributes.RESPONSE</code></li>
</ul>

<p>These will be set to instances of
<code>ActionRequest</code>/<code>ActionResponse</code> or
<code>RenderRequest</code>/<code>RenderResponse</code> in the
<code>processAction</code> and <code>render</code> methods, respectively.</p>

<p>In addition, you may optionally define a collection of request attributes for
your portlet using <a href="http://www.springframework.org/" target="_top">spring
dependency injection</a>.  These attributes my be of any type, and will be
accessible to all scripts in both <code>processAction</code> and
<code>render</code>.</p>
